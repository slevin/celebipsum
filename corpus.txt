It is officially too late to speak now ...  'cause Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are finally husband and wife.

Mr. and Mrs. Kanye West tied the knot Saturday at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy surrounded by family and friends ... and according to on-lookers, Kanye was pretty nervous before the ceremony.

We're told Andrea Bocelli sang as Kim was walked down the aisle by Bruce Jenner.

Our sources say all guests were also required to sign a confidentiality agreement.

Based on pics of the wedding site ... it looks like the reception will be held at the Fort -- but the way things have been going, who knows?!

Kanye and Kim started dating in 2012 and the following year Yeezus proposed after an elaborate ceremony inside San Francisco's AT&T Park.

This is Kanye's first marriage -- and Kim's third.

Mazel tov!

Justin Bieber put on a shirt ... and a dazzling display of humanitarianism at a celebrity gala in Cannes, where he dropped $545K ... for charity.

Bieber -- all gussied up in a black, double-breasted suit -- hit up the amfAR gala, which raises money for AIDS research. People started making huge pledges of money -- one wealthy gent pledged $545K and Bieber -- quietly and without fanfare -- matched it.

We're told the crowd -- which included Leo DiCaprio, Heidi Klum, John Travolta, and Sharon Stone -- was stunned. Justin was asked if he seriously wanted to pledge such a huge amount and he said yep.

Biebs said he just felt inspired to do something good.

Rihanna may dislike Charlie Sheen ... but she really likes the restaurant where she dissed him Wednesday night ... because she came back the next night and made a spectacle of herself.

Rihanna showed up at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica Thursday ... knowing photogs would ask about the war of words between Charlie and her ... ignited after she refused to interact with him and his fiancee during dinner.

In what can be interpreted as an F-you to Sheen, Rihanna got all friendly with gawkers as she walked in ... but ignored questions about Charlie.

Miley Cyrus just got an emergency restraining order against a "delusuional" fan who allegedly said he won't stop hunting her down until she "accepts him or he dies" ... TMZ has learned.

Devon Meek was arrested on May 16 by LAPD's Threat Management Unit, and while in custody he told officers a bunch of crazy things -- like Miley speaks to him through the radio, and he hears screaming voices in head ... this according to court docs obtained by TMZ.

Meek told cops he heard Miley say she "adores" him in one of her song -- and according to the docs, he also told cops they might as well shoot him in the head ... if he can't meet Miley.

24-year-old Meek was placed on a 5150 hold ... and as of yesterday he was still in custody at a mental health facility.

He has to stay 100 yards away from Miley ... according to the restraining order.

It's not listed in the docs, but we're guessing Meek heard the "adore" comment in Miley's hit ... "Adore You."

Lindsay Lohan's motto is when in Rome, Paris, L.A., Secaucus ... Cannes ... doesn't really matter -- as long as you keep the party going ... which she did in a French nightclub last night.

LiLo shrugged off her sobriety struggles, and hit up VIP Room in Cannes -- and while she wasn't seen drinking on camera ... she was surrounded by the worst temptations -- alcohol and French guys.

Lindsay's brother Michael was also there to keep his eye -- and hands -- on her. Yeah, it's a little uncomfortable ... check the video.

Chris Brown is feeling the Rhythm of the Night ... with the guy in the next cell.

The most famous inmate at L.A. County Jail is passing his time singing tunes with the 8th (we're generous) most famous inmate -- James DeBarge.

The two R& B stars are locked up in side-by-side cells -- in the segregated unit for high profile inmates.

We're told they've been collaborating on music and have already written three songs, performing them during the long days ... with other cellmates harmonizing.

This is kind of amazing ... they can't see each other.  It's all about the sounds.

You know why Chris is behind bars.  As for DeBarge ... it's all about those pesky drug convictions.

Wonder who's opening for who?

Cops believe 2 people captured on surveillance video near V. Stiviano's house may be the culprits in the attempted burglary of her home.

Law enforcement sources tell us ... one of Stiviano's neighbors gave this video to cops, showing 2 people traversing the area at the time of the attempted break-in.  TMZ independently obtained the video.

We broke the story ... someone broke Stiviano's front window and tried to jimmy another at her L.A. duplex.

Cops are trying to determine the identity of the 2 people.  We're told so far ... this is their best lead.   The video -- which TMZ acquired with the help of FoxyLux.com -- could help solve the case .

The reason for the attempted burglary is unclear ... but Stiviano's people have put the word out there ... she has more than 100 hours of audio capturing  conversations with Donald Sterling.

Here's Tom Cruise (left) seen out to dinner in London where he's promoting his new movie, "Edge of Tomorrow" ... and John Travolta (right) leaving a party last summer.

Even Adele Dazeem couldn't tell them apart.

The war is over ... Tom Cruise has settled his epic $50 million libel suit against a magazine publisher that accused him of abandoning his daughter Suri ... and part of the settlement included a carefully-worded apology.

The terms of the settlement are sealed. Each side will pay its own legal fees.

Part of the deal was that the defendants issue the following statement:  "Bauer Publishing, 'In Touch' and 'Life and Style' never intended to communicate that Tom Cruise had cut off all ties and abandoned his daughter Suri and regret if anyone drew that inference from anything they published."

As we reported ... Cruise sued Bauer Media Group last year over a cover story that appeared in Life & Style magazine claiming he had "abandoned" his then-6-year-old daughter Suri in the wake of his divorce from Katie Holmes.

The conflict was pretty insane -- you'll recall, Tom sat for a deposition in the lawsuit and compared acting to fighting in Afghanistan.

Regardless, it's all water under the bridge now.

Wanna see supermodel Adriana Lima smack her beautiful face into a sideview mirror? Well, you are sick, twisted ... and in luck!

This video (with bonus slo-mo) of Adriana's accident is awesome -- but more awesomer than a shovel to the head? Watch and decide.

Khloe Kardashian high-styled it outside Paris Friday ... hours before her sister Kim ties the knot with Kanye West.

Khloe -- who by the way looks great -- was at Château de Wideville posing in the gardens.

She was there with Kim, Kris, Kendall AND ... Valentino.

As we reported ... after the ceremony there will be a reception, but the big bash is Saturday in Florence at Fort Belvedere.  There will be a second event in Florence, but Kanye is keeping details top secret.

Reese Witherspoon put her checkered (and awesome) past with cops behind her today ... and donned a police uniform ... right here on American soil!

Reese is playing a police officer in her new movie, "Don't Mess With Texas" ... alongside Sofia Vergara. They're filming down in Louisiana -- where Reese recently did some Karaoke with Kenny Chesney.

Sofia definitely looks like she needs to be frisked, but Reese ... make sure you know her name before slapping the cuffs on her.

Who's obstructing whose justice now?

Alec Baldwin was detained in New York City Tuesday morning after riding his bike the wrong way on Fifth Avenue and 16th street.

Here's the crazy part ... it seems one of the factors in the arrest was that Alec didn't have his ID on him when he was riding.

We're told Alec was taken to the police station so he could be properly identified ... standard ops.

Law enforcement sources tell us Alec was belligerent with officers while in custody ... which resulted in his getting a ticket for disorderly conduct -- on top of the ticket for riding the wrong way.

Sources tell us he was riding alone ... it was just for exercise.  Alec's wife was not there.

The ID part of the story is kind of amazing, because Alec is a fixture in New York.
Barbara Walters may have gotten the mistress and the wife, but Anderson Cooper got the grand prize Sunday ... a sit down with Donald Sterling ﻿... TMZ has learned.

Cooper flew in to Los Angeles this morning, checked into his hotel, and made a bee-line to Sterling's Beverly Hills house, where the interview went down.

Before the interview, Sterling met with his lawyer, who was not present during the interview with Cooper. The interview will air Monday night on "Anderson Cooper 360."

TMZ shot video of Anderson leaving the house after the interview, but he was mum.

Our sources say Sterling has been champing at the bit to publicly defend himself against racism allegations after TMZ Sports posted the now famous recording.

This was Anderson's second bite at the apple -- last week, he tried convincing Sterling to do the interview ... but failed.
