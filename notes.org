* main steps

create a first test
and run it


test get words from corpus
 and that I can get set of words


read in corpus

generate dictionary of pairs
 (initially can be hash table I guess)

based on n-1 or n-2 or n-3
(normalized)

each "word word+1" maps to list of words

then grab random two words
search for match if no match of previous two
then match * other

or could build a trie maybe

(could try both for fun)

need to read in the corpus

need to figure out punctuation
(punctuation might just be a word)

input needs to be normalized

could test my way in making sure that
 it could read in words two at a time and return those
 and continue through the rest of the stream

but then I'm stuck

all the way through till there aren't 3 left

dict of first
  each one points to a dict of

hashtable
 key is two words and object is list of third

then random onej
